So, we pay into the E.U. budget as usual, accept free movement as usual, obey the E.U. regulations as usual, and have no say on how the E.u. is run. Great Brunexit plan Jeremy?

"75% of under 25s voted Remain" - and 75% of under 25s think that Winston Churchill is the dog in the commercial.

The language used in this article is amusing:

Labour’s changed tack on the single market issue is merely described as “a significant shift”.

Had the Tories done exactly the same; it would have been reported as nothing less than a “u-turn”.

What a man of principle Jezza is.

The most important issue for 40 years and Corbyn changes his view 180 degrees for short term political gain.
A contemptible and shallow piece of electioneering for a man whose ONLY redeeming characteristic was supposed to be his authenticity.
