Of course I read it. The assumption that addressing all market segments is necessary for success is simply wrong. What is necessary is a continuous series of desirable products that can be built with good profit margin. Tesla needs to continue to differentiate its products from the competition in the segments in which it chooses to compete such that it can maintain the scale needed to keep down cost. It does not need to be everywhere.
There’s really only one viable player in the EV market now. Only Tesla has an extensive, 120KW, charging network. Without this, every other brand still faces the range anxiety issues for long trips that Tesla solved long ago. No competing network even comes close in ubiquity or charging speed.
The author misses the point of Tesla. 
a) Tesla doesn’t make cars. It makes computers with a wheel on each corner.
b) Think of Tesla like Apple. It doesn’t have to compete with the cheap options. It’s a luxury manufacture and people buy and live the brand. It is a cult, like Apple.
All I can say is this. I called the sales department at a local Jaguar dealership and left a message inquiring about the new electric SUV and how I could order one. 10 days later, and I’ve not received a call back

I don't agree with the majority of these type of incentives. What they incentivize is manufacturers upping their product prices by exactly that amount. Ever wonder if it's a coincidence that the Chevy Bolt is priced at $37,499 when there's a $7,500 "incentive"?
To help reduce environmental and health impact, tax carbon. ICE should have an 'incentive' of +$7,500 from which EVs would be exempted. Gasoline should be taxed based on their carbon contents. Power generation would be taxed the same way.
